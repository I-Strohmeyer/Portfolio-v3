        I'm a self-taught web/frontend developer with experience working with an
        agile team with diverse nationalities. My background in customer support
        und quality assurance inform my user centered approach when tackling
        problems.

        Fueled by my passion for understanding how everything is connected, I
        consider myself a "forever student," eager to both build on my
        foundations in web development, and stay in tune with the latest
        programming paradigms through continued coursework and professional
        development.
